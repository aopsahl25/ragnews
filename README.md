This code runs an interactive question and answer system for news articles using the Groq LLM API and retrieval augmented generation (RAG). It works by fetching articles from a database and processing them to answer from queries from users on current-events. 

An exmaple of how this works is as follows:

```
$ python2 ragnews.py
>ragnews Who is the democratic presidential nominee?
The democratic presidential nominee is Kamala Harris.
```
